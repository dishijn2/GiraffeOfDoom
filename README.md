Mostly python, and mostly about my home magnetometer/sky-camera project (http://homepages.vodafone.co.nz/~Svmalkin/). This is a spinoff and testbed for our work at http://DunedinAurora.NZ

ANNet v0.1 	- play and exploration of artificial neural nets.

DataFusionProject - simple data fusion of a network of nulling magnetometers to improve sensitivity to wide-scale geomagnetic activity

DetectGeomagSpikes - Analysis of dH/dt values to provide simple indicator of geomagnetic activity levels

SerialCatcher_Arduino_MAG3110v3.1 - Modified Arduino code for MAG3110 3-axis magnetometer chip

SerialCatcher_Honeywell_5883/HCM5883 - Modified Arduino code for Honeywell 5883 3-axis magnetometer chip

camera v0.1 - SharpCap python scripts to automate camera imaging and download

pyDataReader v1.7 - Magnetometer logging software. Also generates CSV files for magnetogram display using Highcharts web graphing API, incl 4 hr, 24 hr, dH/dt for past 24 hr, and 1 minute binned values for the past 24 hours to be used in DataFusionProject.

HeatMapper - script to create a heatmap of auroral activity over extended periods of time.
